Very much in progress!

While some people love hand-crafting their own playlists in Spotify, I just tend to throw every song I like into one massive playlist. This results in a huge mix of genres and moods, meaning when I play songs on shuffle, ity's very likely I'm going to here a song that doesn't match the type of music I might want to only listen to at that time.

This application automates the processes of creating sub-playlists based on genre from any playlist you may have.

This solves both problems:

- It automates playlist creation (using songs I already have)
- It groups songs by genre to keep the 'vibe' roughly the same

There might be a thousand criteria under which one might want to build a playlist - My starting criteria for this app is genre :)
